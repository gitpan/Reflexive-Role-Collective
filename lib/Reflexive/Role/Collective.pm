=head1 NAME

Reflexive::Role::Collective - Provides a composable behavior for containers watching contained events

=head1 VERSION

version 1.103460

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflexive::Role::Collective provides are more comprehensive and extensible way
to define collections that act upon events emitted from contained objects.

While Reflex::Collection merely watches for the 'stopped' event and removes it
from the collection, a more sophisticated Collection can be built using this
role that will do much more such as proper socket management, re-emit events,
etc.

=head1 ROLE_PARAMETERS

=head2 collection

    default: objects

store contains the name of the attribute that holds the actual collection of
objects.

=head2 method_add_object

    default: add_object

method_add_object is the name of the method that adds an object to the
collection.

=head2 method_del_object

    default: delete_object

method_del_object is the name of the method that deletes objects from the
collection.

=head2 method_count_objects

    default: count_objects

method_count_objects is the name of the method that returns the current count
of objects within the collection.

=head2 method_clear_objects

    default: clear_objects

method_clear_objects is the name of the method that clears the collection of
any objects.

=head2 method_remember

    default: remember

method_remember is the name of the method that stores the collectible and sets
up watching the events that collectible emits.

=head2 method_forget

    default: forget

method_forget is the name of the method that removes the collectible and
ignores any events that the collectible emits.

=head2 stored_constraint

    default: Any

stored_constraint stores a Moose::Meta::TypeConstaint object to be used to
constraint collectibles before they are stored into the collection.

=head2 watched_events

    isa: ArrayRef[Tuple[Str,Str]], default: []

watched_events contains an arrayref of tuples that indicate the event to watch
and the callback method name to call when that event occurs.

=head1 ROLE_REQUIRES

=head2 ignore

This role requires the method ignore from Reflex::Base

=head2 watch

This role requires the method watch from Reflex::Base

=head2 clear_objects

This role requires the method named in method_clear_objects

=head2 count_objects

This role requires the method named in method_count_objects

=head2 add_object

This role requires the method named in method_add_object

=head2 delete_object

This role requires the method named in method_del_object

=head1 PUBLIC_METHODS

=head2 remember

remember takes an object constrained by L</store_constraint>. It will then
watch all of the events listed in L</watched_events> and store the object
into the collection

=head2 forget

forget takes an object constrained by L</store_constraint>. It will then
ignore all of the events the collection was watching and the object will be
removed from the collection.
